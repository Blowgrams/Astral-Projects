# Astral-Projects
Hello to all who comes across this message, this is my first web development project without tutorials and my biggest issue is
I'm having issues with bootstrap placing items but I cant get the same outcome as the project.
1) How do I place text and a navbar over images and what is a working method to placing items in CSS properly along the columns and rows.
I'm having issues with lining up objects along columns and rows and strech across the whole viewport. 
Attached is a picture of the final copy intended.

Thanks.
